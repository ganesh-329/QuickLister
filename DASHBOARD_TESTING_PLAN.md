# ðŸ“‹ Dashboard Testing Plan

## **Pre-Implementation Testing**

### **1. Verify Current Mock Data Issues**
- [ ] Confirm hardcoded statistics in Dashboard component
- [ ] Document all mock values currently displayed
- [ ] Test dashboard with different user scenarios (no gigs, multiple gigs, etc.)

## **Backend API Testing**

### **2. Dashboard API Endpoint Testing**
- [ ] Test `GET /api/dashboard/stats` with authenticated user
- [ ] Verify response structure matches expected interface
- [ ] Test with users who have:
  - [ ] No posted gigs
  - [ ] No applications
  - [ ] Multiple gigs in different statuses
  - [ ] Multiple applications in different statuses
  - [ ] Completed gigs (earnings calculation)

### **3. Database Query Performance**
- [ ] Test query performance with large datasets
- [ ] Verify all MongoDB aggregations work correctly
- [ ] Test edge cases (deleted users, corrupted data)

### **4. Error Handling**
- [ ] Test with invalid/expired JWT tokens
- [ ] Test database connection failures
- [ ] Verify error responses match API specification

## **Frontend Integration Testing**

### **5. Dashboard Store Testing**
- [ ] Test `fetchDashboardData()` function
- [ ] Verify loading states work correctly
- [ ] Test error handling and error display
- [ ] Test refresh functionality

### **6. Component Integration**
- [ ] Verify all statistics display correctly
- [ ] Test currency formatting
- [ ] Test date formatting
- [ ] Verify status color coding
- [ ] Test responsive design on different screen sizes

### **7. User Experience Testing**
- [ ] Test loading indicators
- [ ] Verify error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Test refresh button functionality
- [ ] Ensure smooth transitions between states

## **Data Accuracy Validation**

### **8. Statistics Verification**
- [ ] **Total Gigs**: Count matches user's actual posted gigs
- [ ] **Active Gigs**: Only includes posted/active/assigned/in_progress statuses
- [ ] **Applications**: Count matches user's actual applications
- [ ] **Earnings**: Calculation includes only completed accepted applications
- [ ] **Pending Earnings**: Includes accepted but not completed applications

### **9. Recent Data Verification**
- [ ] Recent gigs show latest 5 posted gigs
- [ ] Recent applications show latest 5 applications
- [ ] Dates are sorted correctly (newest first)

## **Edge Case Testing**

### **10. Empty State Testing**
- [ ] New user with no data
- [ ] User with only draft gigs
- [ ] User with only rejected applications
- [ ] User with expired/cancelled gigs

### **11. Real-time Updates**
- [ ] Dashboard refreshes after posting new gig
- [ ] Statistics update after receiving new application
- [ ] Earnings update after gig completion

## **Performance Testing**

### **12. Load Testing**
- [ ] Test with users having 100+ gigs
- [ ] Test with users having 100+ applications
- [ ] Verify reasonable response times (<2 seconds)

## **Cross-browser Testing**

### **13. Browser Compatibility**
- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)
- [ ] Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## **Regression Testing**

### **14. Existing Functionality**
- [ ] Ensure other dashboard features still work
- [ ] Verify navigation links work correctly
- [ ] Test quick action buttons
- [ ] Ensure layout doesn't break

## **Post-Implementation Monitoring**

### **15. Production Validation**
- [ ] Monitor API response times
- [ ] Track error rates
- [ ] Validate data accuracy with sample users
- [ ] Collect user feedback on dashboard improvements
